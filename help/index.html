		<h3>How to publish your Maker site</h3>
		<p>
			To publish your Maker site, create an account on this: <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>
			Then sign up for <a href="https://vercel.com">Vercel</a>.
			<br>
			<h4>GitHub + Vercel:</h4>
			Go <a href="https://github.com/new">here</a>, type in a name for your website, and select public or private. Then create it.
			<br>
			Then, tap "Create new file" and on the right of <i>your repo name</i> at the top, type <i>index.html</i>.
			<br>
			In the big text box below that, paste in what you found in the text box at the bottom of the Maker homepage.
			<br>
			Then tap Commit New File.
			<br>
			Now, go to Vercel and tap New Project. Then under Import Git Repository, tap GitHub. Allow Vercel access, then choose the repository you created.
			<br>
			Tap "Select" under your username, then tap continue.
			<br>
			Don't select a framework, or build command, just tap continue. But make sure to make a project name.
			<br>
			Then, wait a little bit and you should see "Congratulations! Your site has been deployed." or similar. Tap on your site's picture to go to it, and that's it!
